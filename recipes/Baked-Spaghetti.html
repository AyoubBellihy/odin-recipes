    <h3>Description :</h3>
    <p>Baked spaghetti is essentially a cross between your classic baked macaroni and another beloved treat: Pinoy spaghetti. The combination of sweet and savory is one that appeals to almost everyone. Letting your pasta bake in the oven really infuses and harmonizes all those flavors together. An effective way to really get all those flavors to mix is to cover it with a layer of aluminum foil before baking. This also makes your baked spaghetti cook a little faster, resulting in that warm, bubbly deliciousness you won’t be able to take your eyes off.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients :</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 (32 ounce) jar meatless spaghetti sauce</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon seasoned salt</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>⅓ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        <li>2 cups small curd cottage cheese, divided</li>
        <li>5 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Directions :</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender but firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir beef and onion in the hot skillet until meat is browned and onion is soft and translucent, about 7 minutes. Drain excess oil from the pan. Stir in spaghetti sauce and seasoned salt.</li>
        <li>Whisk eggs, Parmesan, and butter in a large bowl. Add spaghetti and toss to coat.</li>
        <li>Place 1/2 of the spaghetti mixture in the prepared dish. Top with 1/2 of the cottage cheese, 2 cups mozzarella, and 1/2 of meat sauce. Repeat layers. Cover with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes. Remove the foil and sprinkle with remaining mozzarella. Continue to bake until cheese is melted and lightly browned, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
